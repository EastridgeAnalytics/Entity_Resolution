# Entity Resolution Demo Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates an end-to-end entity resolution pipeline using Neo4j. The notebook shows how to identify and resolve duplicate records caused by near-similarities in your data through a series of well-defined steps.

## Overview

The notebook is organized into distinct sections that guide you through the entire process:

1. **Configuration & Setup:**  
   Imports required libraries, sets up configuration parameters (such as Neo4j credentials, database name, and data generation settings), configures logging, and provides a helper function to obtain a Neo4j driver instance.

2. **Data Generation:**  
   Defines utility functions to clean up previous data, introduce data imperfections (e.g., typos and phone variations), and generate a large number of candidate nodes using the Faker library. Near-duplicate records are injected to simulate real-world data challenges.

3. **Demo Clusters:**  
   Inserts two controlled demo clusters into the database as test cases (for example, a fraud family cluster and a cluster representing multiple variations of a single individual). These clusters help validate the entity resolution logic on a smaller scale.

4. **Data Normalization:**  
   Provides functions to normalize key candidate properties (full names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses) to ensure consistency. The normalization pipeline updates candidate nodes with standardized values, which is critical for reliable similarity comparisons.

5. **Similarity Calculation:**  
   Creates indexes on normalized candidate properties and (optionally) generates blocking keys to reduce comparison overhead. Functions are defined to compute similarity between candidate nodes based on full name, email, phone, and address using metrics such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distances. Similarity relationships (`SIMILAR`) are then created between nodes that meet specified thresholds.

6. **Duplicate Resolution:**  
   Introduces two strategies for handling duplicates:
   - **Merge High Confidence:** Merges candidate nodes whose aggregated similarity score exceeds a specified threshold (a destructive approach).
   - **Link High Confidence:** Creates a `:SAME_AS` relationship between candidate nodes with high aggregated similarity (a non-destructive approach).

7. **Master Entity Resolution:**  
   Consolidates candidate nodes into master nodes. For each unique candidate community (determined from the clustering process), a master node is created and candidate nodes are linked to it. Canonical property values are computed from the candidate nodes to represent the deduplicated, unique entity.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed.
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab** to run the notebook interactively.
- A running **Neo4j database** (we recommend using Neo4j Desktop).  
  Make sure APOC and Graph Data Science (GDS) libraries are installed and enabled:
  - [APOC Installation](https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/installation/)
  - [GDS Installation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/)

### Python Packages

Install the required packages with pip:

```bash
pip install faker neo4j
```

Or via conda:

```bash
conda install faker conda-forge::neo4j-python-driver
```
